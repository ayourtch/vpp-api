# vpp-api-transport

This is a Rust library for interfacing with the VPP API. 

WARNING: quite likely the interfaces may change. This version
(until at least 0.2.0) is to test things out and encourage the feedback.

The idea is to have entity that implements Read and Write traits,
as well as eventually AsRawFd. This should allow to use this
in place where you would use a regular socket in your code.

# Prerequisites

## Rust and OS dependencies

### Rust

As per https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install:

```
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

### OS dependencies

On Ubuntu:

```
sudo apt-get install build-essential libclang-10-dev
```

### VPP client libraries

## Option 1 - your local development VPP tree at arbitrary location

Define the environment variable *VPP_LIB_DIR* to point to the folder where
the file *libvppapiclient.so* is located. You might also have to set the
*LD_LIBRARY_PATH* to the same location as well.


## Option 2 - VPP client from packagecloud.io:

Setup the repository from https://packagecloud.io/fdio/master or the
branch-specific repositories as per instructions, then install
the package *python3-vpp-api*, cargo build will find the library there.

# Usage

See the src/vpp-api-transport-test.rs, more and better docs will
come as we go :-) There is no point to document much here yet,
as the interfaces will change.

# Running *cargo test*

```
sudo apt-get install vpp vpp-plugin-core python3-vpp-api
```


# Running the examples

Same prerequisites as for cargo test, and then:

```

$ cargo run --release --example vpp-api-transport-test -- -h

This program is a minimum test of vpp-api-transport crate To make it somewhat useful, it can also
bench the cli_inband API execution time for various commands

USAGE:
    vpp-api-transport-test [FLAGS] [OPTIONS]

FLAGS:
    -h, --help           Prints help information
    -n, --nonblocking    set non-blocking mode for the connection
    -v, --verbose        A level of verbosity, and can be used multiple times
    -V, --version        Prints version information

OPTIONS:
    -c, --command <command>
            Run the bench using this CLI, else use "show version"

    -o, --options-override <options-override>    Override options from this yaml/json file
    -r, --repeat-count <repeat-count>            repeat count for the command [default: 100000]
    -s, --socket-path <socket-path>
            Use AF_UNIX socket if this path is mentioned, else use shared memory transport

$
$ cargo run --release --example vpp-api-transport-test -- -s /run/vpp/api.sock -r 1000000
